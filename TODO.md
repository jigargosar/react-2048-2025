- [x] score regression
- padding issue in devtools
- unable to play after clicking test buttons, perhaps any button. no first test button is working.
- need to check if overlays are working
- game over test is no longer working
- dialog margin assessment
- try using grid for dialog layout 
- ideally we should create all layouts with flex and grid only, no absolute positioning
